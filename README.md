# Crash Course into Data Science for Hackers
The intent of this course is to teach Data Science fundamentals to Cybersecurity professionals. 
##Getting Started
Throughout the course we'll be using ipython notebook. 

*You can download a copy at: http://continuum.io/downloads#py34*
>If you're not familiar with iPython Notebook please see the [help documentation](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/notebook/notebook.html)

If you prefer to use Python2.x, feel free, but please note that our challenges and exercises were written for Python3.

Anaconda3 comes with most of the [packages](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs) you'll need. Packages you'll also need are:
- apache-log-parser | **pip install apache-log-parser**
- user-agents | **pip install user_agents**
- pydotplus | **pip install pydotplus**

Once Anaconda is installed please type: **run conda update --all**

##Other System Requirements
1. [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
2. [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php) --used to visualize machine learning

##Optional Installs
1. [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)
2. [Apache Drill](https://drill.apache.org/)

##Navigating folders
1. **Worksheets folder** contains exercises, which we will cover together as a class.
2. **Data folder** contains sample data meant to be used for the in class exercises.
3. **References folder** contains all links, handouts, and other course documents.

##Data Science Challenge
We've created an interactive challenge environment for you located at www.datasciencechallenge.com
>When prompted for a username/password, please use: blackhat/2015
There you can register for an account and begin the challenges. Most of the challenges directly relate to the material taught in the course.
